* RSA Factoring Challenge
Algorithm
Scripting

This project is NOT a mandatory project, it's 100% optional!

Scenario: "We have sniffed an unsecured network and found numbers that are used to encrypt very important documents. It seems that those numbers are not always generated using large enough prime numbers. Your mission should you choose to accept it, is to factorize these numbers as fast as possible before the target fixes this bug on their server - so that we can decode the encrypted documents."

Tasks:

- 0. Factorize all the things!
#advanced
Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.
Usage: factors <file>
File: factors

- 1. RSA Factoring Challenge
#advanced
RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that n = p Ã— q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.
This task is the same as task 0, except -> p and q are always prime numbers & There is only one number in the files
